TRUCKS AND DRONES

Truck drives a route, drone can divert for one stop.
Drone can take one package to deliver before going back to the truck on its next stop.
1 truck 2 drones 

You cant recieve on same location 
Only drone or truck per node

Solution representation draft
stops in order with labels for drone launch or retrive.

0,a,11,10,a,b,12,9,b,8,7,b,4,3,b,a,1,b,2,5,a,b,6 # Not same solution instance as he wanted

Here truck goes to stop 0, sends a to next number (11). Goes to 10 and recieves a and send b to next number (12)


LINER SHIPPING with extra smaller boats

Mother starts at a node s and has to end at that same node, with all daughter ships returned.
Mother ship drives to some ports
Smaller daughter ships can divert to different routes when mothership is at some port 
Then daughter ships return to the SAME port as it left from.

ONLY 1 MOTHER 
0 to n-1 daughter vessels.

maybe we can use 2 * n-1 dots in our solution representation.

One example solution representation: DONT think it works (maybe tho with dots), because when daughter vesssels are increased to three the last daughter is not included
PORTS 1234
1 mother 
2 daughter
1a23a4bb
 - Mother goes to 1, sends a to 2 and 3, a returns and mother goes to 4.
 - Daughter ship b is at the end to times to represent that it is not used.

with dots:
solution for mother going to all ports
1234......

solution as above:
1.23.4....





OBLIG 2
Each truck starts at its home node 
A truck does not need to end at its home node

dummy truck 
an extra, use it for feasibility
Outsource
Put things we dont manage to do, can be assigned to the dummy truck and we know it will fulfill.

Inital feasible solution:
outsource everything
for example:
00011223344556677
3 trucks, outsourced everything
