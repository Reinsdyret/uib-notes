store results to not search again
allow non improving moves
use memory to avoid looping

pseudo:
  choose candidates
  choose best with some measure
  update memory (tabu list) and update current

Tabu criterion
  Avoid visiting the same solution several times 
  Cant store all states visited (too big and time consuming)
  We store some attributes. Such as node 4 and 1 was selected or the edge 2,4 

tabu tenure
  The number of iterations you want to keep something in the tabu list
  If we keep it for very long -> gets stuck somewhere easier
  If we keep it short -> Risk of cycles is high
  Dynamic is better:
    Change tabu tenure at certain intervals
    When stuck, increase tenure for that part.

Always accept a solution if it is better than what we have seen. aspiration
Even if it is tabu because we are then guaranteed that we havent visited it before.

all moves are tabu:
  just take one
